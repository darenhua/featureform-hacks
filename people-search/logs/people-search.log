During his time at Dartmouth, Gene has maintained a GPA of 3.8 and has engaged in relevant coursework including Data Structures & Algorithms, Advanced Data Visualization, and FullStack Web Development. In terms of projects, Gene developed a web application called MuseShare from November 2024 to January 2025, designed to allow music enthusiasts to share and review various music-related content, using technologies such as React and MongoDB and leveraging the Spotify API for user engagement. He also created an application titled What if from January to March 2025, which encourages users to explore diverse topics through “what if” discussions, implemented using Expo. Prior to these projects, from June to August 2022, he analyzed sonic features of viral hit songs during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing non-parametric tests and visualizing results with tools like seaborn. Additionally, he worked on a Tiny Search Engine project from September to November 2024, which indexed Dartmouth's CS Department webpages, enhancing search efficiency. Gene's professional experience includes serving as a Research Assistant at the SCRAP Lab in Hanover, New Hampshire, from August 2024 to the present, where he assists in research under Professor Mark Thornton, focusing on personality trait evaluations through automated online experiments. He also holds a position as a Teaching Assistant in the Dartmouth Computer Science Department since March 2025, where he provides guidance in web application development and mentors students on various modern web development technologies. In extracurricular activities, Gene is an athlete for the Dartmouth Rugby Football Club, competing at a national level since August 2023 and contributing to the team’s performance in tournaments. He is also an executive member of the Dartmouth Korean Students Association starting September 2023, where he facilitates connections between students and organizes cultural events.

He began his studies at Dartmouth in September 2023 after completing his secondary education at Woodberry Forest School in Woodberry Forest, Virginia, where he graduated with honors, earning distinctions such as Magna Cum Laude and the Walker Scholar title, in June 2023. During his time at Dartmouth, Gene has maintained a GPA of 3.8 and has engaged in relevant coursework including Data Structures & Algorithms, Advanced Data Visualization, and FullStack Web Development. In terms of projects, Gene developed a web application called MuseShare from November 2024 to January 2025, designed to allow music enthusiasts to share and review various music-related content, using technologies such as React and MongoDB and leveraging the Spotify API for user engagement. He also created an application titled What if from January to March 2025, which encourages users to explore diverse topics through “what if” discussions, implemented using Expo. Prior to these projects, from June to August 2022, he analyzed sonic features of viral hit songs during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing non-parametric tests and visualizing results with tools like seaborn. Additionally, he worked on a Tiny Search Engine project from September to November 2024, which indexed Dartmouth's CS Department webpages, enhancing search efficiency. Gene's professional experience includes serving as a Research Assistant at the SCRAP Lab in Hanover, New Hampshire, from August 2024 to the present, where he assists in research under Professor Mark Thornton, focusing on personality trait evaluations through automated online experiments. He also holds a position as a Teaching Assistant in the Dartmouth Computer Science Department since March 2025, where he provides guidance in web application development and mentors students on various modern web development technologies. In extracurricular activities, Gene is an athlete for the Dartmouth Rugby Football Club, competing at a national level since August 2023 and contributing to the team’s performance in tournaments. He is also an executive member of the Dartmouth Korean Students Association starting September 2023, where he facilitates connections between students and organizes cultural events. Through his academic, project, professional, and leadership experiences, Gene Park has developed a diverse skill set in computer science, programming, and organizational collaboration, while actively participating in the Dartmouth community.Brian Tran, currently based in Boston, Massachusetts, is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at Hamilton College, expected to graduate in May 2025. He was selected as a QuestBridge Match for a full scholarship based on academic merit. Throughout his academic career, he has engaged in several relevant courses, including Computer Networks, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, which have equipped him with a strong foundation in the field. Brian has undertaken notable projects, such as Marzipans.app, a cybersecurity tool developed in collaboration with Eric Olsen, the Cybersecurity Director at JetBlue. This application, built using AWS, Linux, React, and other technologies, assists companies in monitoring their publicly accessible domains and features a scalable database architecture, domain file uploads, and payment integration. Another significant project is Visaq.app, which displays historical data on visa appointment wait times globally, employing web scraping techniques and a RESTful API to manage data retrieval. He also contributed to a data visualization project involving brain proteins, employing various Python libraries to enhance the analysis and reduce execution time significantly. In terms of professional experience, Brian was a Finance and Marketing Intern at Aflac from June to August 2022, where he utilized SQL, Tableau, and Excel to analyze data for over 10,000 policyholders, assisting in life policy pricing decisions. He conducted in-depth financial analyses and managed a portfolio of policyholders while obtaining two authorized New York Health Insurance Agent Licenses. Prior to that, he served as a Website Developer Intern at John Hancock from June to August 2021, where he led the development of an internal information website for the START Program, creating a responsive platform using Microsoft SharePoint alongside HTML and CSS. This website streamlined onboarding processes for over 50 interns and supervisors annually. Brian’s technical skills encompass a range of programming languages, including C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as technologies such as AWS and MongoDB. His interests extend into various domains, including computer science, cybersecurity, and design. Through his academic and professional endeavors, Brian has demonstrated a commitment to leveraging technology for innovative solutions while building a robust portfolio in software development and data analysis.", 'next_convo_topic': "- Gene, with your impressive background in creating web applications like MuseShare and What if, and your interest in music, I'm curious if you've come across any fascinating music-related projects or insights through the Spotify API that you'd like to share?\n\n- Brian, your project Marzipans.app sounds incredibly innovative, especially with its focus on domain monitoring in cybersecurity.

2025-06-15 14:09:52,521 - PeopleSearch - INFO - Adding conversation analysis: The conversation discussed the variety of clinical trials and how they are assigned to different sites. The speaker explained that sites can be awarded different types of trials, such as schizophrenia trials, healthy volunteer trials, Japanese bridging trials, and vaccine trials. They also mentioned that time coordinators typically start with a smaller workload, often in a backup capacity, before taking on more responsibilities. Given your technical backgrounds and the discussion about clinical trials, I'm curious about your thoughts on international collaboration in research. Brian, with your experience in creating Visaq.app that deals with global data, and Gene, with your involvement in research at the SCRAP Lab, how do you think cultural and geographical differences impact research methodologies and data collection, particularly in clinical trials?
